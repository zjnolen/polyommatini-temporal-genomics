First, we will take a look at the general quality of our results to make
decisions about final methods, as well as if there are any biases that must be
considered in our analysis. This will also generate a large table populated with
sample information used in the supplementary material.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| code-summary: Load up required packages and setup species and genome lists

library(data.table) # For reading in data while skipping columns
library(stringr) # For separating pop names into regions and sampling years
library(ggplot2) # For plotting
library(ggpubr) # For adding stats to graphs
library(cowplot) # For arranging plots into a multi-panel figure
library(knitr) # For rendering tables with kable

species <- c("picarus", "pargus", "csemiargus")
speclab <- c("P. icarus", "P. argus", "C. semiargus")
genomes <- c("ilPolIcar1.1", "ilPleArgu1.3", "ilCyaSemi1.1")
```

## Sample info table

First, let's set up the table that will become Table S1, with the main sample
info and a few key sample level stats.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-samples

# First, read in sample coverage data, keeping only the mapping rates and depth
# info for unfiltered and filtered sites. Since we are testing how to address
# post-mortem DNA damage, we will make a table for no damage correction,
# mapdamage rescaling, and transition removal

qc_all <- c()

for (s in species) {
  g <- genomes[match(s, species)]
  for (m in c("mapdam", "notrans", "trans")) {
    qc <- fread(
      paste0(
        "../angsd/results/datasets/historical-",
        s,
        "-",
        m,
        "/qc/historical-",
        s,
        "-",
        m,
        ".",
        g,
        "_all.sampleqc.tsv"
      ),
      header = TRUE,
      sep = "\t",
      select = c(
        "sample", "population", "time", "perc.total.map",
        "allsites-unfilt.depth.mean", "allsites-unfilt.depth.stdev",
        "allsites-filts.depth.mean", "allsites-filts.depth.stdev"
      )
    )
    qc$damcorr <- m
    qc$species <- s
    qc_all <- rbind(qc_all, qc)
  }
}

# Next, read in identity by state to the reference estimates. We will use only
# the estimates for the filtered sites lists as they are what is relevant to
# the actual analyses.

ibs_all <- c()

for (i in c(1:length(species))) {
  s <- species[i]
  g <- genomes[i]
  for (m in c("mapdam", "notrans", "trans")) {
    ibs <- fread(
      paste0(
        "../angsd/results/datasets/historical-",
        s,
        "-",
        m,
        "/qc/ibs_refbias/historical-",
        s,
        "-",
        m,
        ".",
        g,
        "_all_allsites-filts.refibs.tsv"
      ),
      header = TRUE,
      sep = "\t",
      select = c("sample", "ibs.to.ref")
    )
    ibs$damcorr <- m
    ibs_all <- rbind(ibs_all, ibs)
  }
}

# Merge QC and IBS tables

qc_all <- merge(qc_all, ibs_all, by = c("sample", "damcorr"))

# Add data prevenance information

qc_all[qc_all$time == "historical", "source"] <- "MZLU Pinned Specimen"
qc_all[qc_all$time == "modern", "source"] <- "Field Caught"

# Update data types
qc_all$time <- factor(qc_all$time,
  levels = c("historical", "modern"),
  labels = c("Historical", "Modern")
)
qc_all$species <- factor(qc_all$species, levels = species, labels = speclab)
```

## Reference bias and DNA damage

As historical samples will have degraded DNA, we need to consider how we will
address this difference between historical and modern samples. One method would
be to rescale the putatively damaged bases with MapDamage2 [@jÃ³nsson2013],
another would be to remove transitions, which are what DNA damage is likely to
manifest as. The former will leave us with the most data, but may lead to
overcorrecting true transitions, while the latter should remove damage by
removing all transition, but will remove a lot of variation data.

We can assess how each of these methods perform by comparing the identity by
state similarity to the reference when using each. Additionally, this will allow
us to see if there is a reference bias induced by the shorter fragment length of
the historical samples. All of the following checks will take place using our
filtered sites list, as this removes variation induced by poor mapping around
repetitive content and similar challenging regions.

```

We can see that the uncorrected historical samples are more distant to the
reference than the modern ones, and that there is more variation in the
individual IBS scores in the historical samples. This is good, as it suggests
that our samples do not have a reference bias from smaller fragment size.
Likely, the extra variation in IBS score is due to differences in per sample DNA
damage, and we can see that while both methods of correction reduce this
variation, it is best in the transition removal scores. Additionally, while in
*C. semiargus*, both methods do not 'overcorrect' and result in reference
biased historical samples, in the other two species, MapDamage induces
substantial reference bias to the historical samples.

For this reason, we decide to move forward using transition removal as our DNA
damage correction method. Next, we check to make sure that after this correction
we don't see any biases from fragment length or depth of coverage in sample IBS
scores.

It appears that while fragment size has no notable impact on IBS scores, mean
sequencing depth has a slightly negative relationship with IBS scores in all
historical samples and a slightly positive relationship with IBS scores in all
modern samples. However, the actual IBS scores are still very close

Now, we will add some extra fields to prepare our data table for use as the main
sample information supplementary table.

```{r}
# Convert population to year and region columns, dropping time and population

qc_all$region <- str_sub(qc_all$population, 1, -5)

regname <- c("SE SkÃ¥ne", "SW SkÃ¥ne", "Ãland", "E SkÃ¥ne", "SmÃ¥land", "W SkÃ¥ne")
qc_all$region <- factor(qc_all$region, levels = regions, labels = regname)

write.table(qc_all[qc_all$damcorr == "notrans", ],
  file = "../tables/sample_info.tsv", sep = "\t",
