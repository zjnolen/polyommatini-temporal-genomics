# Configuration for calculating GERP scores from outgroups aligned to the target
# reference. This is done per reference genome, as the ancestral states and GERP
# scores are determined in reference to the given genome. For each reference,
# the reference path is supplied, as well as a path to a folder containing the
# outgroup genomes. There is a folder per reference, containing all utilized
# references except the target. This just generates ancestral states and GERP
# scores for our reference genome, we then use our own scripts to use these to
# calculate relative load, but the method is similar to what GenErode would do.
